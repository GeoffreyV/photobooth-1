### Chromakeying isn't working if I access the Photobooth page on my Raspberry Pi, but it works if I access Photobooth from an external device (e.g. mobile phone or tablet). How can I solve the problem?

Open [chrome://flags](chrome://flags) in your browser.
Look for "Accelerated 2D canvas" and change it to "disabled".
Now restart your Chromium browser.
